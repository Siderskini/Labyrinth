The purpose of this document is to keep a bucket list of things that I want to do to make the app less buggy and more fun to play

- Keypress handling
	- Need to treat all keypresses as keyholds for more fluid movement
	- Currently, when a directional key is held, an initial keypress is registered and 	  then after a delay, this changes to a keyhold event. I want to bypass the delay.

- When rendering, I want the screen to center on player when the player is more than half a window away from a border
	- When (playerx > window.innerWidth/2) or (playerx < maze_width -
	  window.innerWidth/2) I want to render from (playerx - window.innerWidth/2)
	  to (playerx + window.innerWidth/2)
	- When (playery > window.innerHeight/2) or (playery < maze_height -
	  window.innerHeight/2) I want to render from (playery - window.innerHeight/2)
	  to (playery + window.innerHeight/2)
	- Cases:
		- 1 Player is close to left and upper
		- 2 Player is close to left and lower
		- 3 Player is close to left and no vertical border
		- 4 Player is close to right and upper
		- 5 Player is close to right and lower
		- 6 Player is close to right and no vertical border
		- 7 Player is close to no horizontal border and upper
		- 8 Player is close to no horizontal border and lower
		- 9 Player is close to no border
	- Conditionals:
		if (playerx < canvas.width/2) {
			if (playery < canvas.height/2) {1}
			elif (playery > maze_h - canvas.height/2) {2}
			else {3}		
		} 
		elif (playerx > maze_w - canvas.width/2) {
			if (playery < canvas.height/2) {4}
			elif (playery > maze_h - canvas.height/2) {5}
			else {6}
		}
		else {
			if (playery < canvas.height/2) {7}
			elif (playery > maze_h - canvas.height/2) {8}
			else {9}
		}
	- Player rendering:
		- 1: 
	- The map now moves as it is supposed to, but the player doesn't remain centered 	  when the player is supposed to remain centered
		- One way to fix this is to accommodate for the shift in
		  socket.on(locations)
