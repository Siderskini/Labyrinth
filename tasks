The purpose of this document is to keep a bucket list of things that I want to do to make the app less buggy and more fun to play

- Keypress handling
	- Need to treat all keypresses as keyholds for more fluid movement
	- Currently, when a directional key is held, an initial keypress is registered and 	  then after a delay, this changes to a keyhold event. I want to bypass the delay.

- Rendering
	- The client side crashes if the maze is smaller than window size (large window or
	  zoomed out)
	- The graphics has some lag because the emit for the render locations and the emit 	  for game state are separate
	- Rendering is currently done with 10fps based on emit events from server to
	  client side

- Meta
	- Want to decide on some game mechanics including:
		- Dots to collect
		- Keys and an exit
		- A minotaur/ other adversaries
		- Some traps, like in the underground in Pokemon 4th gen games


- Enemies
	- There is currently a randomwalk mob called 'mob'
	- There are now low level intelligence mobs called 'smarty's that have limited UCS
	  playerfinding algorithms
	- Eventually I want to make a very intelligent mob called 'boss' with supreme
	  intelligence, but idk how to make this happen
	- To make enemy pathfinding more efficient, I might want to make a second map with 
	  locations mapped to players so that I can reduce runtime and make enemy 
	  pathfinding more efficient. This might take a little bit of overhead.

- Safe zone
	- Players now spawn in a safe zone
	- Safe zones are stored in a boolean grid
	- Enemies do not enter the safe zone
	- There is no food in the safe zone

- Sometime, I need to move all of the TILE_S bullshit to the client side so that server side doesn't need to do unnecessary divisions
