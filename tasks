The purpose of this document is to keep a bucket list of things that I want to do to make the app less buggy and more fun to play

- Keypress handling
	- Need to treat all keypresses as keyholds for more fluid movement
	- Currently, when a directional key is held, an initial keypress is registered and 	  then after a delay, this changes to a keyhold event. I want to bypass the delay.

- Rendering
	- The client side crashes if the maze is smaller than window size (large window or
	  zoomed out)
	- The graphics has some lag because the emit for the render locations and the emit 	  for game state are separate

- Meta
	- Want to decide on some game mechanics including:
		- Dots to collect
		- Keys and an exit
		- A minotaur/ other adversaries
		- Some traps, like in the underground in Pokemon 4th gen games


Enemies
	- I want there to be one final boss and various mobs
	- I'm trying to figure out how to store the boss and the enemies in a data structure

If I use a list to store mobs, it will have to be a list of objects, with mob type being an attribute
If I store a list of mobs as objects, I will need a function to create a rendering grid for the client. There's the question of whether to host this function on server side or client side. If I want the items in the grid to be differentiable from each other, then either
a) the server side creates the enemy render grid and passes it over to the client side with enemy ids
b) the server sends the list over to the client side and the client side just renders based on the map

- Want to add time based events
